# Homework 08

## Provided Code and Files

# Part 1: word_lib.py


# Part 2: doc_stats_builder.py

👉🏽 **Task**: 

## Testing


### Integration Testing
Integration testing is testing how the functions work together. In this case, you can use the doc_stats.py file to test how the functions work together. This actually executes the program, which you can run with various examples,and then save the output of the runs to make sure they are working! 




# Part 3: README.md

👉🏽 **Task**: Answer the questions in the [README.md](../README.md) file. 

Make sure to answer the questions in the [README.md](../README.md) file.

As always you are free to ask about the questions in MS Teams, including clarifications on the code. 

## 📝 Grading Rubric

For this assignment, you will submit:
* word_lib.py
* doc_stats_builder.py
* README.md
* Any test files you created including output captured from running the tests and your final program run.
  * Basically, you are proving you tested it, and it works as expected! :) 

While we provide tests, reminder, you should test your own code before submitting!

1. Learning (AG)
   * 
2. Approaching  (AG)
   * 
3. Meets  (AG)
   * 
4. Exceeds  (MG)
   * README.md questions answered
   * Proper comments and docstrings throughout code
   * Test files provided / evidence of testing and running the program
  

AG - Auto-graded  
MG - Manually graded



### Submission Reminder 🚨
For manually graded elements, we only guarantee time to submit for a regrade IF you submit by the DUE DATE. Submitting late may mean it isn't possible for the MG to be graded before the AVAILABLE BY DATE, removing any windows for your to resubmit in time.
